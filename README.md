# Women-Politics

This project analyzed data relating to 180+ political leaders around the world. I worked with python, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to visualize data comparing the relation of political structures to the percentage of female leaders, and presented final analysis with data visualizations. Both presentation and data analaysis code are included.
